# TraGT

Implementation of fusion learning approach that integrates graph-based and sequence-based model to enhance molecular property prediction for optimised drug discovery pipeline.

Graph-based model used is Graph Transformer
Sequence-based model used is Transformer Encoder

The proposed model, TraGT, is compared with various state of the art graph-based models (like GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT) and sequence-based models (like RNN, LSTM)
